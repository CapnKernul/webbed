# webbed - take control of HTTP [![StillMaintained Status](http://stillmaintained.com/CapnKernul/webbed.png)](http://stillmaintained.com/CapnKernul/webbed) [![Build Status](http://travis-ci.org/CapnKernul/webbed.png)](http://travis-ci.org/CapnKernul/webbed) #

Webbed provides useful abstractions on top of the basic parts of the HTTP
specification, most notably HTTP Requests and Responses. It is far more
full-featured than `Rack::Request` and `Rack::Response`, allowing you to easily
access the complex features of HTTP.

## Usage ##

Coming soon. Check out the tests and documentation in the meantime.

## Installation ##

Without bundler:

    gem install webbed

With bundler:

    gem "webbed"

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests ##

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, but do not mess with the `Rakefile`. If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump the version in a commit by itself in another branch so I can ignore it when I pull.
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for git flow feature branches.
